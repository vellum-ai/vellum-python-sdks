# Session Context: Workflow Triggers Implementation

## Current Objective
Implementing workflow-level trigger system with serialization support, starting with ManualTrigger (Phase 1 of multi-phase plan).

## Progress Summary
- Added `BaseTrigger` and `ManualTrigger` classes for workflow triggering
- Implemented trigger serialization in workflow display system with `WorkflowTriggerType` enum
- Simplified trigger type handling by removing speculative future trigger types (INTEGRATION, SCHEDULED)
- Removed unnecessary validation for multiple trigger types

## Active Work
Branch `feature/manual-trigger` is complete and pushed. Ready for PR review.

## Key Decisions & Context
- **Specific trigger classes over generic**: Future triggers will be `SlackTrigger`, `GitHubTrigger`, etc. rather than `IntegrationTrigger` with config union
- **WorkflowTriggerType enum**: Created with single `MANUAL` value; will expand as new triggers are added
- **Single trigger serialization**: Current implementation serializes only first trigger from `trigger_edges[0]`. This is acceptable for Phase 1 (only ManualTrigger exists). Will need update to serialize array when multiple triggers are supported (Phase 2+)
- **YAGNI applied**: Removed speculative code for integration/scheduled triggers since they're 1-6 months out per planning doc

## Next Steps
1. Create PR for review
2. Note in PR that serialization format will need update from `workflow_raw_data["trigger"]` (singular) to `workflow_raw_data["triggers"]` (array) when multiple trigger support is implemented
3. Phase 2: Implement integration triggers (SlackMessageTrigger, EmailReceivedTrigger, ChatMessageReceived)
4. Implement state operations framework per planning doc
