# Introduction

[Vellum](https://www.vellum.ai/) is the end-to-end development platform for building production-grade AI applications.

### Core Features

- **Orchestration:** A powerful SDK and IDE for defining and debugging the control flow of your AI applications
- **Prompting:** A best-in-class prompt playground for iterating on and refining prompts between models from any provider
- **Evaluations**: An evaluations framework that makes it easy to measure the quality of your AI systems at scale
- **Retrieval:** A ready-to-go service for turning unstructured content into intelligent, context-aware solutions
  optimized for AI systems
- **Deployment:** Decouple updates to your AI systems from your application code with an easy integration +
  one-click deploy
- **Observability:** Monitor and debug your AI systems in real-time with detailed logs, metrics, and end-user feedback

## Get Started

Most functionality within the SDK requires a Vellum account and API key. To sign up, [talk to us](https://www.vellum.ai/landing-pages/request-demo)
or visit our [pricing page](https://www.vellum.ai/pricing).

Even without a Vellum account, you can use the Workflows SDK to define the control flow of your AI systems. [Learn
more below](#workflows-sdk).

## Client SDK

The Vellum Client SDK, found within `src/vellum/client` is a low-level client used to interact directly with the Vellum API.
Learn more and get started by visiting the [Vellum Client SDK README](/src/vellum/client/README.md).

## Workflows SDK

The Vellum Workflows SDK is a high-level framework for defining and debugging the control flow of AI systems. At
it's core, it's a powerful workflow engine with syntactic sugar for declaratively defining graphs, the nodes within,
and the relationships between them.

The Workflows SDK can be used with or without a Vellum account, but a Vellum account is required to use certain
out-of-box nodes and features, including the ability to push and pull your Workflow definition to Vellum for editing
and debugging via a UI.

To learn more and get started, visit the [Vellum Workflows SDK README](/src/vellum/workflows/README.md).
